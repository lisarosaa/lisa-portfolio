            <p>A world without water is a documentary film directed by Brian Woods in 2006. The documentary attempts to explain
                how water becomes a valuable commodity that often leads to conflict over resources between the poor and the
                rich. Through his film, Wood depicts the water conflict from different parts of the world: Bolivia, India,
                Tanzania, and the USA (Detroit). The film gives several points of view through interviews from the government,
                private companies, activists, NGOs, and the Bretton Woods Institutions (in this case, World Bank). A world
                without water is an 'eye-opener.' It depicts how people often struggle to get access to the water, yet some
                people never understand how fortunate they can be with an easy water tap. Water is essential to life, water
                is a basic human right, and water is a universal resource; three essential messages that Woods tries to explain
                in his documentary.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Water conflict is everywhere.</b>
            </p>
            <p>The story unfolds four different stories about the lack of water access. The first story follows an 8-years old
                Vanessa and her family in El Alto, Bolivia. They had to get the water from an unreliable well even though
                their house is only a few hundred meters from the Aguas del Illimani's water plant (a subsidiary of French
                water private company, Suez). Their conflict arose when the company tried to block their access to the water
                by increasing the tariff. Vanessa and her family had to feel saddened when her brother died, and her little
                sisters were affected by diarrhea due to unhealthy water consumption. On the other hand, the local authority
                encouraged civil disobedience to illegally cut the water pipe due to the inability to afford high-cost water
                tariffs.
            </p>
            <p>The second story takes place in Rajasthan, India, a battle between poor villagers and a multinational company,
                Coca Cola. Most of the villagers rely on the shallow well to irrigate their farmland and household consumption.
                Unfortunately, since the company built its factory, the villagers faced water shortages because of the excessive
                use of groundwater for soft drink production. The local farmers kept questioning why the company had to build
                their factory in Rajasthan, which is known for its water shortage. The conflict, then, led to a massive protest
                from the locals to shut down the factory.</p>
            <p>The inability to provide basic water needs for their citizens led to a privatization scheme in Dar Es Salaam,
                Tanzania. To meet their water needs, the poor often need to buy their daily water from the pushcart men with
                high costs. Consequently, the government signed the privatization scheme with aid from the World Bank and
                British consortium company (City Water). However, the privatization turned out to disserve the poor, in which
                they got much less water, but the bill continued to increase. In conclusion, the government withdrew from
                the contract as they found out the City Water aimed to maximize their profit only.</p>
            <p>The last story illustrates the struggles of Betty, one of 40,000 citizens of Detroit, USA, who was being shut-off
                from the water, as she cannot pay off their high water bill. The conflict started when the Detroit Water
                Board aimed to strive for profit and increase the tariff by privatization. Depressed by their situation,
                Betty illegally cut the water pipe to survive their life.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Commodification of water.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The documentary shows how privatization is only beneficial for the rich and takes advantage of the poor. For some cases,
                the poor people are often a victim of governmental policy with assistance from private companies which are
                more profit-oriented. If we look back on how privatization can be widely used in developing countries, it
                started in the early 70s when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan introduced economic reform of Neoliberalism
                in both the UK and the USA, respectively. Both of them believe in a free market and privatization of public
                service as an answer to economic stability. Later on, the agent of Neoliberalism, the Bretton Wood Institute,
                such as the World Bank and IMF, then persuaded developing countries to follow their way by privatizing public
                services while using their funding. That is portrayed by the documentary, how privatization slowly takes
                off what used to be a human right, charges high tariffs for common-pool resources, and creates classes in
                the society.
            </p>
            <p>
                We clearly can see how water is treated as a commodity, and commodification of water is happening in some places around the
                world. The idea of commodification of natural resources came as prevention of tragedy of the commons who
                were coined by Garrett Hardin in 1968. As humans tend to exploit as many natural resources as possible individually,
                they need to be managed carefully to ensure environmental sustainability. In the Dar Es Salaam case, the
                World Bank tried to govern the resources by privatizing the water resources that were once free for all citizens.
                In the documentary, the World Bank stated that they try to help developing countries to prevent environmental
                destruction and teach them how to use water resources properly. However, in reality, privatization has become
                a "disaster" for the poor people who have difficulty to meet their daily needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                That example is a strong misconception of treating public goods that benefit everyone. Water is fundamental for human life,
                and the government must ensure all citizens can access water equally. And yes, privatization is not the only
                answer to prevent the tragedy of the commons. In her publication of Governing the Commons in 1990, Elinor
                Ostrom introduced self-governance through collective action: "a group of principals can organize themselves
                voluntarily to retain the residuals of their own efforts" (Ostrom, 1990 p.39).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Water is the new 'oil'.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays, population growth creates a high demand for freshwater, and not all regions can support it with their resources.
                It is estimated that around 57 percent of the global population will suffer from water scarcity in their
                area (UN Water, 2018). Yet, this condition could be much worse concerning the way the human lifestyle in
                recent years. Human consumption leads to more freshwater needs in agriculture and cattle. Excessive groundwater
                extraction, disruption of the hydrological cycle, and the climate change phenomenon are just a few examples
                of threats that could decrease our valuable resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                Water is the new oil, is a phrase that is commonly used by most researchers to illustrate the importance of water nowadays.
                The prolonged war over oil since the 1980s in Persian Gulf State could be replaced by water wars. This hypothesis
                became a concern for some researchers who believed that the water wars would become a reality in the near
                future. Some potential water wars are predicted in the international rivers, such as Jordan River, Tigris
                River, Euphrates River, and Nile River (Bulloch and Darwish, 1993). In addition, during a conference in Stockholm
                in 1995, the World Bank Vice President, Ismail Seragelding, stated that in the future, the next battle would
                be over water, not oil.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Water is for all.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                This documentary successfully shows the importance of water and depicts how we can't live in a world without water. The United
                Nations even recognized in Goal 6 of Sustainable Development Goals that access to clean, safe, and sufficient
                water and sanitation is a basic human right. Through this documentary, all the people realize the importance
                of water and can't live without it. They even do all the "unnecessary" things to get the water for their
                life, for example, illegally cut the water pipe or lead a massive demonstration. The film successfully shows
                different perspectives of water conflict in a "neutral" way. Without accusing one particular person or institution
                as the wrong one, the film tries to collect all the facts and information into a comprehensive one. Woods
                can play with our emotional feelings when we see an 8-year-old Vannesa has to go through her harsh childhood
                life because of her economic condition. From the documentary, we can see that even in one of the most powerful
                countries like the USA, the water conflict is happening. Overall, the documentary is worth watching for everyone
                who wants to get deeper into the water issue, the failure of market forces, and privatization.
